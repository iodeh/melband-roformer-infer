# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Added direct registry coverage for all 20 checkpoints in the `pcunwa`
  Mel-Band Roformer family: Big Beta 1-7, Small, Instrumental V1 variants,
  Kim FT variants, and InstVoc Duality V1/V2. Existing MelBand architecture
  code handles these configuration variations; weights remain runtime
  downloads with `not-reviewed` license metadata pending upstream clarification.

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### MLX backend (Apple Silicon)

Twin change with bs-roformer-infer's identical MLX backend addition.

- Added a `backend` argument alongside `device`, on `MelBandRoformerSession`,
  `MelBandRoformerSeparator`, `separate_folder()`, and the CLI (`--backend`). It
  accepts `torch` (default), `mlx`, and `auto`. `device` keeps its exact existing
  Torch meaning; the two are independent axes. Requesting an unavailable backend
  raises `BackendUnavailable` immediately -- before any checkpoint is resolved or
  downloaded -- and is never silently swapped for a different one; `auto` is the
  single place a fallback happens, because there it is what the caller asked for.
  `cache_info()` now reports the resolved `backend` and `device`.
- Internal: chunked inference moved behind a `SeparationBackend` seam
  (`mel_band_roformer.backends`), ported from bs-roformer-infer's identical seam.
  `run_folder()` keeps its signature and behaviour; the backend-agnostic half is
  now `separate_folder_with()`. `demix_track()`'s chunk/step/fade/border numbers
  now come from the shared `ChunkingPlan` instead of being computed a second time.
- Added an MLX backend behind the optional `[mlx]` extra (`mlx`, `mlx-spectro`),
  with the MLX MelBand-Roformer model vendored from `mlx-audio-separator` (MIT,
  ssmall256, commit `0ddc8cf5507906b52ac45a9cd9e6d26e881a93f8`) rather than taken
  as a dependency. It consumes this package's own sha256-verified checkpoint and
  config -- no second catalog, no separate converted-weight cache. Weight
  conversion raises rather than loading partially: upstream's `strict=False`
  silently drops unmatched keys, which would leave layers at random
  initialisation and produce confident garbage.
- Worked around the same MLX 0.31.2 Metal `rfft` correctness bug bs-roformer-infer
  found and fixed on the sibling BS-Roformer architecture: the kernel returns
  roughly `4.5e-07` instead of exactly `0` for an all-zero frame, which this
  model's normalization then amplifies into a full-scale random feature vector
  that corrupts an entire chunk via time-axis attention. Since every track's
  final chunk is padded (and music has rests), this affected ordinary use.
  Measured on the real default checkpoint, end to end through the public session
  API: a silent-tailed track's maximum absolute error against Torch went from
  `4.5e-02` with the workaround disabled to `1.8e-07` with it enabled -- roughly
  the same noise floor as a track with no silence at all (clean signal: `8.4e-08`;
  near-silent tail: `4.9e-09`). Guarded by `tests/test_mlx_parity.py`, whose
  silent-tail cases fail loudly if the workaround is removed.
- Two porting bugs the auditing weight loader caught and this port fixes, neither
  present in the shipped Torch model:
  - Upstream's vendored MLX code applies a trunk-level `final_norm` after the
    transformer stack, in addition to each Transformer's own trailing norm. This
    package's own Torch `MelBandRoformer` has no such layer -- each Transformer's
    own norm is the only normalization the trunk ever applies, so a checkpoint
    never trains a `final_norm` weight. Omitted rather than left at random init.
  - This package's own Torch `MLP()` (used by the mask estimator) builds `depth`
    hidden layers for a given `depth` value; bs-roformer-infer's Torch `MLP()` --
    and the vendored MLX `MLP()` copied from it -- builds `depth - 1`. Copying
    that helper verbatim would have built a shallower MLP than any checkpoint was
    trained with. The two sibling packages' `MLP()` depth semantics genuinely
    differ; this is not a bug in either package on its own, only in copying one's
    helper into the other without re-deriving it against that package's own Torch
    model. Fixed to match this package's own `MLP()`.
  - This package's registry (`config/checkpoints.toml`) declares no
    mask-estimator variations, so unlike bs-roformer-infer's four-head MLX
    coverage, this backend only needs the stock head today; the refusal hook for
    an unsupported variation is still wired (`tests/test_backends.py`) so a future
    variant checkpoint fails loudly instead of mis-running.
- Fixed a latent double-release bug found while wiring the backend seam:
  `MelBandRoformerSession.release()` previously called `.cpu()` on its own model
  reference *and* (once a backend existed) the backend's `.release()` did the
  same on the same underlying object. Now `release()` defers entirely to the
  backend when one exists.
- Fixed a latent architecture-divergence bug: the MLX backend's
  `mask_estimator_depth` fallback (`2`, inherited from vendored upstream)
  disagreed with the Torch constructor's owning default (`1`), so a config
  omitting the key silently built a different architecture per backend from
  the same checkpoint. The auditing weight loader failed loudly on the
  mismatch, but loudly-wrong is still wrong. Masked in practice because every
  registry config sets the key explicitly. Guarded by a test asserting the MLX
  fallback equals the Torch constructor's own signature default, so the two
  cannot drift apart again.
- `checkpoints.py` now carries a real header (the dual-registry relationship --
  a strict 21-model TOML layered on the legacy 99-entry JSON, failure modes,
  a verified `Reads:` line) instead of a one-line docstring an audit had to
  read the whole body to substitute for. `ChunkingPlan` is now exported through
  the `backends` barrel instead of forcing `utils.py` to reach past it into
  `.backends.base`.
- Fixed the two long-standing `test_device_resolution.py` failures: both
  asserted that an explicitly requested `"cuda:0"` survives device resolution
  unchanged, but neither declared CUDA as available, so they passed only on a
  CUDA host and failed everywhere else, including the Apple Silicon hosts this
  branch exists to support. No implementation change -- the tests now
  monkeypatch availability/device count the way the sibling
  `cuda:0`-index test already did. Suite now 83 passed, 1 skipped, 200
  deselected, 0 failed.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-08-01

### Added
- `run_folder()` (and the `MelBandRoformerSession.infer()` / `MelBandRoformerSeparator` /
  `separate_folder()` facades above it) now accept an `output_format` keyword
  (`"wav_float32"` (default, unchanged behavior) / `"wav_s16"` / `"flac16"`) that controls
  the `sf.write` subtype and output file suffix for both the per-instrument stems and the
  derived instrumental. `"flac16"` writes `.flac` files at `PCM_16` -- FLAC has no float
  subtype, an expected format limitation, not a bug. The CLI (`proc_folder`) keeps its own
  default of `wav_float32` unchanged; callers opt into FLAC explicitly.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-07-12

Hotfix: added explicit `numba>=0.61.0`/`llvmlite>=0.44.0` floors. Without
them, installing this package alongside another (e.g. bs-roformer-infer)
in the same environment could make the resolver backtrack numba all the
way down to a ~2021 release whose llvmlite build-checks the Python version
inside `setup.py` at exec time rather than via package metadata — pip/uv
can't skip it, so the build explodes on Python 3.11+. Found by testing a
real, plain `pip install` of both packages together (not just via the
project's own lockfile) immediately after the 0.1.4 release.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-07-12

Weights-UX campaign (org Weights UX contract, constitution art. 4): real
integrity verification, true auto-download, and a configurable weights folder.
Twin change with bs-roformer-infer 0.1.4.

### Added
- **sha256 verification wired into downloads**: `data/checksums.json` records
  the known-good sha256 + size for all 71 assets whose download URLs were live
  in the 2026-07-12 audit (53 checkpoints + 18 configs). Hashes were obtained
  from Hugging Face LFS pointers (authoritative content-address oids) and
  cross-verified against independently downloaded local copies for
  MelBandRoformer.ckpt
  (`87201f4d31afb5bc79993230fc49446918425574db48c01c405e44f365c7559e`,
  913,106,900 bytes — two local copies) and big_beta6.ckpt (one local copy).
  `download_file`/`verify_file_integrity` now check the hash after every
  download; a mismatch deletes the file and retries instead of keeping a
  corrupt checkpoint. The previously dead `get_file_hash()` helper is now the
  actual verification path. Assets without a recorded hash fall back to the
  old non-empty check and say so.
- **Auto-download on first use**: `melband-roformer-infer` no longer requires
  `--model_path`/`--config_path` — when omitted, the registry model selected
  via the new `--model` flag (default: MelBand Roformer Kim) is resolved from
  the models directory and downloaded (sha256-verified) if missing, via the
  new public `ensure_model_assets()` API (also exported from the package
  root). Explicit paths still win and skip auto-resolution.
- **Configurable weights folder**: downloads now default to
  `~/.cache/melband-roformer-infer/` instead of the CWD-relative `./models`.
  Overridable via the `MELBAND_ROFORMER_MODELS_PATH` env var, the inference
  CLI's `--models_dir`, the download CLI's `--output-dir`, or the API's
  `models_dir=` argument. A legacy `./models` directory is still searched as
  a read fallback so pre-0.1.4 downloads keep working without re-fetching.
- `tests/test_weights_ux.py`: offline unit tests for the hash-verification
  wiring (including a fake-response download that must reject a wrong sha256
  and delete the file), the models-dir resolution order, and a lock that every
  live HF override checkpoint carries a recorded checksum.
- **`.github/workflows/test.yml`**: push/PR-triggered CI, closing a gap found
  in an org-wide audit — the only prior workflow was `publish.yml`, which
  builds/tests on a single pinned Python (3.10) at release time only, so
  nothing ran between releases. Matrix covers Python 3.10-3.13 (all four
  verified locally: 43 passed, 177 deselected — the `network`-marked tests
  that hit real weight hosts, already excluded by `addopts = "-m 'not
  network'"`). A `build` job (needs `test`) does the wheel-from-sdist smoke
  test: `python -m build`, install the wheel into a clean venv, import
  `mel_band_roformer` and touch `MelBandRoformer`, and confirm the wheel
  bundles no `.ckpt` weight file (constitution art. 7). Twin change with
  bs-roformer-infer's test.yml.

### Changed
- Version is now single-sourced from `src/mel_band_roformer/__about__.py` via
  hatch's dynamic version; `pyproject.toml` and `__init__.py` no longer carry
  duplicate literals.
- README: weights section rewritten to state the auto-download behavior, the
  manual download recipe (exact URL + sha256 + target path), and the folder
  resolution order truthfully. The previous "integrity verification" feature
  claim described code that never ran; it is now accurate. Availability note
  refreshed with the 2026-07-12 re-audit numbers: 37 of 89 models fully
  usable, 36 checkpoints dead, 10 models fully dead (unchanged from the
  0.1.2 audit; two HF-hosted overrides, `inst_gaboxFv8.ckpt` and
  `inst_gaboxFv8B.ckpt`, are also confirmed dead).

### Removed
- Google Colab quickstart notebook (`notebooks/quickstart_colab.ipynb`) and
  the README's Colab badge/section — maintaining a separate notebook
  environment alongside the PyPI package was more upkeep than the audience
  justified.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-07-11

Twin-drift backport campaign: bs-roformer-infer was forked from this project and
later accumulated three real bug fixes that were never ported back. Porting them
here, adapted to melband's config/naming, plus two trivial pre-existing nits.

- **Fix**: `inference.py` now loads YAML configs through `SafeLoaderWithTuple`
  instead of plain `yaml.safe_load`. Some community training configs embed
  `!!python/tuple` tags for `multi_stft_resolutions_window_sizes`, which the plain
  safe loader rejects outright; the custom loader downgrades the tag to a list,
  which `utils.get_model_from_config` already converts back to a tuple.
- **Fix**: `inference.py`'s `run_folder` now reads `target_instrument` via
  `getattr(config.training, "target_instrument", None)` instead of direct attribute
  access, so configs that omit the key entirely (rather than setting it to `null`)
  no longer raise `AttributeError`.
- **Fix**: `inference.py`'s `run_folder` now guards the instrumental-stem write with
  `if instruments:`, so a config that resolves to an empty instruments list no
  longer raises `IndexError` on `instruments[0]`.
- **Fix**: `utils.get_model_from_config` now filters the config's `model` section
  through a `valid_params` allowlist before constructing `MelBandRoformer`, so an
  unknown/future config key is dropped instead of raising `TypeError`.
- **Fix**: `utils.demix_track` now falls back from `config.inference.chunk_size` to
  `config.audio.chunk_size` (and finally a hardcoded default) instead of assuming
  `chunk_size` always lives under `inference`, matching older config schema
  variants.
- **Fix**: `attend.py`'s `Attend` gained an optional `scale` constructor override
  (defaults to `None`, preserving the existing `head_dim ** -0.5` default) plus
  `print_once` diagnostics on GPU backend selection, for parity with the twin.
- **Fix**: `download.py`'s CLI `--help` epilog referenced the nonexistent
  `mel-band-roformer-download` command; corrected to the actual console script name,
  `melband-roformer-download` (see `pyproject.toml`'s `[project.scripts]`).
- **Cleanup**: removed 5 orphaned entries from `download.py`'s
  `STATIC_CHECKPOINT_OVERRIDES` -- checkpoint filenames that don't match any
  registry entry in `data/melband_models.json`, so the override could never be
  reached by `get()`/`search()`. The one entry that is reachable
  (`MelBandRoformer.ckpt`, the `DEFAULT_MODEL`'s checkpoint) was kept.
- **Add**: `tests/test_twin_backports.py` -- targeted regression tests for the
  `inference.py`/`utils.py`/`attend.py` fixes above (yaml tuple tag parsing,
  missing target_instrument, empty instruments guard, valid-params filtering,
  chunk_size fallback, `Attend` scale override).

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-11

Twin-sync campaign: brought this project up to the same standard its twin
bs-roformer-infer reached in its own 0.1.2 release.

- **Fix**: `packaging` was imported in `attend.py` (to gate flash attention on
  torch>=2.0) but never declared as a dependency in `pyproject.toml` -- the same
  bug the twin bs-roformer-infer fixed via community PR #1. Added
  `packaging>=14.1` to `dependencies`.
- **Fix**: full liveness audit of every checkpoint/config URL the download
  pipeline resolves to (121 unique URLs across 89 registry models) found 92
  dead. One is the exact jarredou-account-deletion pattern the twin hit:
  `overrides.json`'s `config_mel_band_roformer_karaoke.yaml` pointed at a
  `huggingface.co/jarredou/...` repo, and that account is now fully gone
  (confirmed 404 on the account page itself). Repointed 43 dead
  checkpoint/config entries -- including the jarredou-tainted one and its
  paired checkpoint (`KaraokeGabox.ckpt`) -- to `Politrees/UVR_resources`, an
  actively-maintained public mirror of the same UVR/roformer model set,
  cross-referenced by exact/case-insensitive filename match and HEAD-verified
  live before adding. Fully-broken models (both checkpoint and config dead)
  dropped from 32 to 10; the `DEFAULT_MODEL` (`melband-roformer-kim-vocals`)
  was never affected.
- **Add**: `tests/test_download.py` -- locks the `DEFAULT_MODEL`'s
  packaged-config invariant and the jarredou-tainted override's new mirror URL,
  so a future silent revert fails tests instead of shipping quietly.
- **Add**: `tools/check_weights_liveness.py` + `tests/test_weights_liveness.py`
  -- a `pytest.mark.network`-gated liveness check (skipped by default; run with
  `pytest -m network`) that HEADs every registry download URL. Ported from the
  twin bs-roformer-infer.
- **Add**: file-top nav headers (title + rationale + `Reads:` deps) across all
  source modules and the test suite, matching the twin's convention.
- **Add**: publish workflow now gates on the test suite (`needs: [test]`)
  before publishing to PyPI.
- **Docs**: README's example model table swapped two currently-dead example
  slugs for live ones, and added a note pointing at
  `tools/check_weights_liveness.py` for anyone relying on a specific model in
  a pipeline.
- **Known limitation**: ~52 registry URLs are still dead (mostly Gabox
  instrumental/vocal checkpoint variants not carried by the mirror used above,
  plus a handful of others) and could not be matched to a live source with
  reasonable confidence in this pass. These predate this release rather than
  being a new regression -- see the twin-sync campaign report for the full
  per-model breakdown. Tracked as follow-up work, not blocking this release.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-01-13

- See git history prior to this file's creation.
## Unreleased

- Added the additive `MelBandRoformerSession` lifecycle facade and package-owned
  `config/checkpoints.toml` checkpoint metadata.
- Added fourteen strict-load and short-forward-probed MelBand-RoFormer checkpoint
  declarations: pcunwa Big Beta 7 and Inst V2, becruily vocals/instrumental/
  deux/karaoke/guitar, anvuew de-reverb main/less-aggressive/mono, and Sucial
  aspiration main/less-aggressive plus de-reverb-echo v1/v2.
- Added six more strict-load and short-forward-probed MelBand-RoFormer
  checkpoint declarations from nomadkaraoke/python-audio-separator's
  `model-configs` release: Mel-RoFormer Viperx 1143, Kim InstVoc Duality
  V1/V2, Sucial De-Reverb Big/Super Big, and Sucial De-Reverb-Echo Fused.
  The probed De-Reverb-Echo V2 release asset was skipped as a renamed duplicate
  of the already-registered Sucial V2 checkpoint by sha256.
- Fixed MelBand multi-output inference to write only the config-declared stems,
  while single-target models still derive the configured residual stem.
- Repaired the session lifecycle: `load()` is idempotent, `release()` is
  reloadable, and `close()` is terminal/idempotent (including context-manager
  cleanup). `cache_info()` now shares the loader's path resolver without
  downloading or creating cache directories.
- Device selection now validates explicit `cpu`, `cuda`, `cuda:N`, and `mps`
  requests; unavailable explicit accelerators raise while legacy automatic
  CUDA-or-CPU behavior remains unchanged.
- The default model's downloader now reads URL, filename, size, and SHA-256
  metadata from packaged `config/checkpoints.toml`; non-declared legacy model
  variants retain the existing registry fallback.
